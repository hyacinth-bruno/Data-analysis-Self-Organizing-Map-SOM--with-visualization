# Data analysis Self Organizing Map SOM  with visualization

Self-Organizing Map (SOM) Analysis for Bike Sharing Data
The som_analysis function in this repository offers an insightful exploration of bike-sharing behavior. Utilizing Self-Organizing Maps, it visually represents complex relationships in the data, allowing us to recognize underlying patterns related to the time of day, duration of trips, and days of the week.

Key Features:
Data Normalization: Before training the SOM, the features (hour, trip duration, day of the week) are normalized to enable effective learning.

SOM Training: A 6x6 SOM is trained with the MiniSom library to capture topological and metric relationships between the data points.

U-Matrix Visualization: The function provides a U-Matrix visualization, where the landscape of light and dark colors represents clusters of similar and dissimilar behaviors in bike usage. Light areas highlight similar usage patterns, while dark regions denote dissimilarity.

Interactivity: Through the visualization, you can gain intuitive insights into how different aspects of bike-sharing are interconnected.

Usage:
This analysis is part of a broader bike-sharing analysis system, allowing users to explore bike-sharing statistics across different U.S. cities, filter by time frames, and delve into user demographics.

By utilizing SOM, this module adds a layer of depth, enabling a more nuanced understanding of the data. It's not just about knowing the numbers; it's about seeing the big picture of how people interact with bike-sharing services in their daily lives.

Feel free to explore, contribute, and adapt this code to your needs!
