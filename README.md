# Data analysis Self Organizing Map SOM  with visualization
  The som_analysis function visualizes bike-sharing data using Self-Organizing Maps (SOM). It normalizes features related to time, trip duration, and weekdays, then trains a 6x6 SOM, and presents a U-Matrix. This helps identify patterns and clusters in bike usage, offering an intuitive understanding of bike-sharing behavior
